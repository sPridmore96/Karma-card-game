      <h2>The Rules!</h2>
      <br>
      <p>This is a version of a card game called Karma. From playing this game with different people the rules always vary so here are the rules for this game...
        Majority of the time the aim is the play a higher card than the one played before you. there is exceptions.
        these are called magic cards. excluding exceptions 4 is the lowest and Ace is the highest card.
        Magic cards can be played at any point regardless of what was played before. If a player has no cards that can abide by the rules then the player will pick up the cards on the table stack</p>
        <div class="rules__container">
          <br>
          <p>2 --- Reset, Resets the table deck and allows the following player to play any card
          </p><br>
          <p>3 --- Invisible, invisible is almost like the card hasn't been played. the player takes a turn to play it and the card copies the Value and any rule applied to the card underneath it.</p><br>
          <p>7 --- Lower Than, The clues in the name, this is the only card that when played the following person has to play lower than a 7</p><br>
          <p>8 --- Miss ago, when played the following person must miss ago. this is also like a 2 in the respect it resets the table Value stack so anything can be played following it.</p><br>
          <p>10 --- Burn, the number 10 card when played removes the stack on the table and puts it to a burn pile. This new burn pile is now considered out of the game and the cards will not be played with again in that game.</p><br>
