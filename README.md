# version-of-cardGame

This is a version of a card game called Sh*t Head. 
From playing this game with different people the rules always vary so here are the rules for this game...

Majority of the time the aim is the play a higher card than the one played before you. 

there is exceptions. these are called magic cards. 

excluding exceptions 4 is the lowest and Ace is the highest card.

Magic cards can be played at any point regardless of what was played before.

If a player has no cards that can abide by the rules then the player will pick up the cards on the table stack

MAGIC CARDS --- :

2 -Reset,  Resets the table deck and allows the following player to play any card

3 - Invisible, invisible is almost like the card hasnâ€™t been played. the player takes a turn to play it and the card copies
the Value and any rule applied to the card underneath it.

7 - Lower Than, The cluse in the name, this is the only card that when played the following person has to play lower than a 7

8- Miss ago, when played the following person must miss ago. this is also like a 2 in the respect it resets the table Value
stack so anything can be played following it.

10 - Burn, the number 10 card when played removes the stack on the table and puts it to a burn pile. This new burn pile is now
considered out of the game and the cards will not be played with again in that game.
